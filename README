PreferenceFu
============

This plugin, greatly inspired by Jim Morris' blog post (http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2007/08/07/bit-vector-preferences) aims to make it easy and flexible to store boolean preferences for an ActiveRecord model. This can be also used as a very quick way to setup an ACL.

Because the values are stored within a bit vector, a virtually unlimited number of preferences can be created without additional  migrations.

Feel free to email me with any suggestions or problems.

Setup
=====

Simply add an integer column to each table of the database that requires preferences. By default, the column used is 'preferences', but by defining a method called preferences_column this can be modified.

	def preferences_column
		'other_column'
	end
		

Examples
========

Using PreferenceFu is very simple.

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	
		has_preferences :send_email, :change_theme, :delete_user, :create_user
		
		set_default_preference :send_email, true
	
	end
	
For new AR objects, all preference options will be set to false. This can be overwritten using set_default_preference. I really recommend you read the 'Warning' section below.

Setting a preference:
	...individually
	@user.preferences[:delete_user] = true 
	
	...mass assignment (useful with the params hash)
	@user.preferences = {:delete_user => true, :create_user => true}
	

Fetching a preference:
	@user.preferences[:change_theme]  => false
	

Enumerable...
	@user.preferences.size  => 4
	
	@user.preferences.each do |key, value|
		puts "#{key} is set to #{value}"
	end
	

Warning
=======

This works by taking the index of the splat supplied in has_preferences as the power of two, summing all values, and storing the sum in the preferences column. Because of this, the first item in the splat will be identified by 1, the second by 2, the third by 4, etc. Once you start using PreferenceFu in production, add new options to the *end* of the splat. At the moment, there's no safe way to delete a preference item at the moment. Any advice is welcome!
